-About


Hello, my name is Alexa! A 20-year old, First Generation student attending Seattle Central College to complete the Software and Development Track in partnership with Year Up. I find passion in enjoying the little things and setting goals to start my path to succeed in projects I sign up for.  Prior to this, I was attending the University of Washington-Bothell and planning on majoring in Interdisciplinary Arts with a focus in Performance Dance and Global Studies. With this in mind, the classes I am taking:

Business Communications, Web Programming & Web Concepts, and Business Application in Excel will help me to learn more about being a professional in any industry. I am bilingual as I speak Spanish in Peruvian and Latin American lingo. A former Spanish translator and transcript writer. Most of my work consisted of translating learning engagements and briefs. My translation work is in the Learning in Places webpage.

  Aside from this, family, dancing, and my work are my top priorities. Having hobbies such as writing, cooking, and working out are important for my daily life. At times, I volunteer and strive to do so long-term. I am passionate about many things and helping others is my main one. Helping is about being empathetic to another person and treating others outside of your family with respect and consideration. Do not wait to be treated well first. Do not be disrespected. The best way you treat yourself, treat others is a motto of mine. 
  Thank you!
